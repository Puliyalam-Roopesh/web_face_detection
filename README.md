# web_face_detection
A web-based facial authentication system built with React. This application demonstrates how to implement facial recognition for user authentication using client-side processing and secure serverless functions.

## Features

- Face detection and recognition for authentication
- User registration with facial template storage
- Login/logout functionality
- Dashboard for authenticated users
- Real-time webcam integration
- Beautiful, responsive UI with animations

## Project Structure

```
├── src/                  # React frontend
│   ├── components/       # UI components
│   ├── context/         # React context for auth state
│   ├── App.tsx          # Main application component
│   └── main.tsx         # Entry point
├── supabase/
│   └── functions/       # Edge Functions for secure processing
└── package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Registration**: Users provide a username and capture their face via webcam
2. **Authentication**: The system compares the captured face with stored templates using secure edge functions
3. **Access**: Upon successful authentication, users gain access to the dashboard

## Security Notes

This is a demonstration project and includes simplified face recognition. In a production environment, you would:

- Use a more robust face recognition algorithm
- Implement proper encryption for facial data
- Add additional security measures (e.g., liveness detection)
- Store data securely in a proper database

## Technologies Used

- React with TypeScript
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase Edge Functions for secure processing
- Webcam integration for facial capture
